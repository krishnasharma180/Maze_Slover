# Maze Solver in C++ (DFS & BFS)

A C++ program that solves a maze using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithms.
---
## Features
- DFS uses a stack for deep path exploration.
- BFS uses a queue for level-wise traversal, ensuring the shortest path.
- Visualizes the final path in the maze:
  - DFS path marked with `*`
  - BFS path marked with `.`

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o main
   ```
2. Run the executable:  
   ```bash
   ./a.exe
   ```
3. Enter your choice when prompted:  
   - `1` for DFS  
   - `2` for BFS
